## What is a TDPLAN?

Team Design Plans (TDPLANs) are **collaborative thinking across multiple branches** -- capturing ideas, brainstorming, investigating, planning, making decisions that span branch boundaries. Each participating branch owns section + works within it.

**This IS for:**
- Cross-branch design work where multiple branches each have responsibilities
- Coordinated planning where branches need to see each other's progress
- Problems touching multiple systems needing parallel investigation
- Shared decision-making where each branch contributes domain expertise

**This is NOT for:**
- Single-branch thinking -- that's DPLAN (Design Plan)
- Building code or executing tasks -- that's FPLAN (Flow Plan)
- Quick fixes -- just do those directly

**TDPLANs have no fixed structure beyond Team Sections.** Shared sections above are starting points. Add sections, remove sections, go wherever thinking takes you. Team Sections below are structured part -- each branch owns theirs.

**When plan ready to build**, create FPLANs per branch: `drone @flow create . "Subject"`. Each branch can create their own FPLAN from their section. TDPLAN stays as shared design record.

**Never trim TDPLAN.** Story -- conversations, decisions, dead ends, pivots -- as important as results.

## Vision
What we're trying to achieve together

## The Problem
What exists now + why it needs multiple branches to solve

## The Fix
High-level approach -- how pieces fit together across branches

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Options | Leaning | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Example  | A / B   | A       | Why   |

## Team Sections

**Each branch owns their section. Edit freely within your section. Don't touch other sections.**

## Listen (TTS-friendly summary)

Write a plain English summary of this plan here. No markdown, no symbols, no tables, no code blocks, no asterisks, no bullet points. Just natural sentences that can be read aloud by a text to speech tool. Update this section whenever the plan changes significantly.
