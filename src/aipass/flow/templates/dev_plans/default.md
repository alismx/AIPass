## What is a DPLAN?

Design Plans (DPLANs) are **thinking** -- capturing ideas, brainstorming, investigating, planning, making decisions. Space where conversations, research, design work get written down so they can be reclaimed later.

**This IS for:**
- Capturing idea or concept worth exploring
- Brainstorming + design discussions
- Investigating problem -- sending agents to research, running tests, gathering data
- Planning upgrade, refactor, or ! feature before building it
- Recording decisions + reasoning behind them
- Anything that needs thought through before (or instead of) executing

**This is NOT for:**
- Building code or executing tasks -- that's FPLAN (Flow Plan)
- Quick fixes -- just do those directly

**DPLANs have no fixed structure.** Sections below are starting points. Add sections, remove sections, go wherever thinking takes you. DPLAN might be quick idea capture or 50-phase investigation -- both valid.

**When plan ready to build**, create FPLAN: `drone @flow create . "Subject"` (default for focused tasks, `master` for multi-phase builds). DPLAN stays as design record.

**Never trim DPLAN.** Story -- conversations, decisions, dead ends, pivots -- as important as results.
